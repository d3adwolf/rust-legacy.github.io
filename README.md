So, I'm writing the very first version of my README, specifically to prevent blocking my GitHub repository.

**So, first:** I do not claim that all files are 100% mine and it was only me who created them. No, more often I take ready-made projects from GitHub and "bring them to mind".

**Second:** Many "my" projects will be stored on GitHub, and not on some Google Drive because GitHub is a guarantee of the reliability of files and their availability. Time goes by, some authors abandon their projects (repositories), sometimes even delete them, so someone like me tries to save their works and distribute them to certain target communities, that is, those who will be interested.

**And third:** If I wrote something wrong somewhere or chose the wrong license for the repository, before throwing the report at me, take it and write to me by mail, please. I always answer during the day and for any conflicts, I am always ready to resolve peacefully and come to a compromise.

Others this README, I hope you understand that I, as a keeper of history, nostalgia, and valuable bytes, and not a stupid schoolboy who decided to use GitHub as a file exchange. I want to develop and help develop different gaming and non-gaming communities, I hope you have the same good goals.
