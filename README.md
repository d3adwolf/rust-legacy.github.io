Greetings everyone,<br>

This repository stores the old version of the game Rust, called Legacy, as well as the old version of the game to create a server.<br>

The server version uses licensed DLL files of the game to enable support of the pirated version: transfer files `Steam.dll`, `steam_api.dll` and `ValveAPI.dll` from the pirated version to the server folder. <br>

All the necessary files can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/d3adwolf/rustlegacy/releases) and on the [website](https://d3adwolf.github.io/rustlegacy/), if you have any questions please contact [issues](https://github.com/d3adwolf/rustlegacy/issues), closed questions and problems on the [second tab in issues](https://github.com/d3adwolf/rustlegacy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
